SegrePresentation
=================

A Macaulay2 package for computing presentations of Segre products of graded rings.

Overview
--------

The `SegrePresentation` package provides tools for constructing a presentation of the Segre product
of two graded rings over a common coefficient field. Given two rings `R` and `S`, the main function
produces a map from the tensor product of `R` and `S` to the polynomial ring generated by the Segre
product, and computes the defining relations.

This package is particularly useful for explicit calculations in projective geometry and commutative
algebra involving Segre embeddings.

Installation
------------

Clone this repository and load the `.m2` file in Macaulay2:

    load "SegrePresentation.m2"

Usage
-----

The main function is:

    segrePresentation(R, S, VariableName => prefix)

- `R`, `S`: Homogeneous coordinate rings over the same coefficient field.
- `VariableName => prefix`: (Optional) A string or symbol used as the prefix for the new variables
  in the target ring. Defaults to `p`.

Example:

    R = QQ[x_0..x_2, Degrees => {{1,0},{1,0},{1,0}}];
    S = QQ[y_0..y_1, Degrees => {{0,1},{0,1}}];

    load "SegrePresentation.m2";
    (segreMap, segreRing) = segrePresentation(R, S, VariableName => "p");

    describe segreRing

This will produce the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Segre embedding ℙ^2 × ℙ^1 → ℙ^5.

Requirements
------------

- Macaulay2 version 1.25.0 or higher (recommended)
- The `Normaliz` and `Polyhedra` packages should be installed (only used internally if required)
